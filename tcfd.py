    ##### What Can You Expect?
    - An overview and skeletal draft of transition and physical risks.
    - Aim to save 10% - 30% of your time in drafting TCFD reports.
    - Better performance observed with larger companies with an established online presence.
    - Unsure which company to pick? [Try one from here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_companies_of_Singapore#Notable_firms).

    ##### Why TCFD specifically?
    - The TCFD framework aligns business incentives with climate impact 
    - It frames climate issues in terms of risks and opportunities that impact the business; a language familiar to execs and decision makers.
    - Companies act in line with their self-interests to mitigate risks, capture opportunities, and reduce their impact on the climate.
